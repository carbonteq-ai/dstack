# CarbonTeq dstack fork ledger

## Status

Candidate and unpublished. The working tree is based on upstream dstack
`0.20.29` at commit `2f9618f4d521140350efd1b344412d122c1e0322`.
`origin` still points to `dstackai/dstack`; a CarbonTeq `origin` and upstream
remote must be configured before publication. No consumer may select this
checkout until the delta is committed, pushed, and recorded by full SHA.

## Maintained delta

### Honor bounded task stop duration

Upstream resolves `stop_duration` in the server job model but omits it from the
runner payload. The Go runner consequently uses a fixed ten-second wait, while
the server independently schedules container removal after ten seconds. A
five-minute job setting therefore gives a training process only about ten
seconds to finalize Trackio evidence and checkpoints.

The candidate delta:

- includes `stop_duration` in
  `src/dstack/_internal/server/schemas/runner.py`;
- derives the server removal deadline from the resolved job setting in
  `src/dstack/_internal/server/background/pipeline_tasks/jobs_terminating.py`;
- adds the nullable field to
  `runner/internal/runner/schemas/schemas.go`;
- derives the Go command wait delay from that field and preserves zero as
  immediate termination in
  `runner/internal/runner/executor/executor.go`;
- rejects `stop_duration: off` before task submission in
  `src/dstack/_internal/server/services/jobs/configurators/task.py`;
- retains a 300-second fallback for legacy stored jobs that predate the
  bounded validation; and
- leaves the eventual shim timeout at zero because the outer grace interval
  has already elapsed.

Regression coverage is in:

- `src/tests/_internal/server/services/runner/test_client.py`;
- `src/tests/_internal/server/background/pipeline_tasks/test_terminating_jobs.py`;
- `src/tests/_internal/server/services/jobs/configurators/test_task.py`;
- `runner/internal/runner/schemas/schemas_test.go`; and
- `runner/internal/runner/executor/executor_test.go`.

The maintained behavior is finite and zero stop duration for task workloads.
Unbounded `off` is intentionally unsupported until the terminating pipeline
can continue polling runner state without repeatedly initiating termination.

## Compatibility and release

Build the server, runner, and shim from the same fork commit and give the
runner/shim one matching component version. A mixed rollout is unsafe:

- a patched server with an old runner still gives the process ten seconds;
- a patched runner with an old server receives no bounded field; and
- a new component version is required for dstack worker reconciliation to
  install the binaries.

The supported production path is dstack tasks on Linux AMD64 SSH-fleet workers
using Docker. The runner sends the interrupt to the launched process, so the
job shell must `exec` the stable worker command or forward signals.

## Validation

The candidate passed:

```text
83 affected Python tests passed, 21 PostgreSQL variants skipped
Go runner schema and executor packages passed
Ruff check and format check passed
git diff --check passed
```

Before publication, repeat the Python suite with PostgreSQL enabled, build the
server and both binaries from the immutable candidate commit, and run a live
Docker cancellation whose handler takes more than ten seconds but less than
the configured stop duration. The release must prove the finalizer marker,
Trackio terminal state, container removal, and worker-idle state.

## Rebase and retirement

Rebase from the exact upstream tag or commit, then inspect the runner payload
schema, task configurator, terminating pipeline, Go job schema, and executor
cancel path as one conflict-sensitive unit. Run all tests above plus the live
cancellation gate. Retire the fork only after an upstream release propagates
the same bounded value through both server and runner and passes the CarbonTeq
qualification unchanged.
